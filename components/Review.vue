      It isn't as easy as saying 'Wonder Woman 1984' is a good or bad movie. The
      pieces are there, and there are moments I adore, but it does come across
      as a bit of a mess, even though the action sequences are breathtaking. If
      you're a fan of the original film, you'll be more willing to take the
      ride, but for those more indifferent, it may be a bit of a blander sit. If
      you can and are planning to watch it, the theatrical experience is the way
      to go - there is nothing like seeing these stunning sets, fun action
      scenes and hearing Zimmer's jaw-dropping score like on the big screen. -
